<!-- AdSense placeholder for child-directed sites -->
<!-- IMPORTANT:
  1) In your AdSense account, enable settings for child-directed content (COPPA).
  2) Use only contextual ads. Do NOT enable personalized/interest-based ads.
  3) Place ads away from game interaction areas to avoid accidental clicks.
  4) Limit to a maximum of 2-3 ad units per page for a good user experience.

  Note: AdSense itself doesn't have a per-tag child-directed flag like Google Publisher Tags (GPT) in Ad Manager.
  Ensure your SITE is marked appropriately in Google settings and your Privacy Policy reflects child-directed status.
